# Capacity-Surfaces
The paper investigates the impact of two key hyperparame-
ters, the number of hidden layers and the maximum number of units per
layer, on the accuracy of neural networks. The study aims to provide in-
sights into how to design more effective and efficient neural networks for
a given task. To compute the accuracy of neural networks based on their
hyperparameters, we used the LCBench benchmark data as training in-
put for several types of surrogate models which were compared to select
the best model for building the capacity surface for each dataset. The
model was used to create a capacity surface that shows the relationship
between the parameters defining the architecture of the network.
